##  :pushpin:Task 1: Software Configuration
### :green_book:Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the  challenge portfolio?

My name is Joanna. I decided to take part in the challenge because I have been developing my skills in **manual** and **automated testing** for over a year. I want to systematise my knowledge and skills to take the next step towards becoming a good tester. I believe that :computer:**practice is definitely more valuable than theory alone**, which is why I chose this project to get started! The :point_right:**individual feedback**:cloud will give me valuable tips on how to work further and what I can do better. I plan to **complete all tasks on time**::white_check_mark:, gain as much knowledge and skills as possible and meet new people with whom I can support myself together. 

:tada:**Let the adventure begin!!!**:tada:
